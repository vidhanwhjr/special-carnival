                 <h1>Topic: Black Holes!</h1>
                 <p>They are the most dangerous and uncontrolable object in space! They will eat anything that comes their way.. Stars, planets etc. The grow bigger by either eating star planets etc. for a lot of time or 2 black holes merge toghether.
                     We cannot acually see black holes. We only see a big shadow with a really bright ring around it. We get to know if the black holes are actually black holes by studying the movement of the stars around them.
                 </p>
                 <h1> Types of black holes: </h1>
                 <p>
                     1. Primodrial Black Holes.
                     <br>
                     These black holes are some of the rarest black holes you can see. They are some of the oldest object in the universe. probrably older than atoms! sceinteist are still trying to determine if the actually exist in the universe. They can be as small as protons but their mass is that of a mountain!
                 </p>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <h2>Now lets move onto the black holes we are sure that exist!</h2>
                <p>
                    2. Stellar Black holes!
                    <br>
                    These are some of the bigger black holes in the universe. Lets take the size of our sun. It is about 2 million trillion trillion kgs. The smallest stellar black hole, The GW170817 is 2.4 times the mass of the sun
                    but it is only as big as paris.
                    <br>
                    another stellar "lightweight" black hole is the companion to the V723 mon red giant star. The V723 mon star is 24 times the size of our sun and 30 million km wide. yet it is thrown around by a black hole named unicorn only 17.2 kms wide!
                    This black hole is so much smaller that we can barely show them in comparision!
                    <br>
                    One of the biggest stellar black hole is the M33X7. It currently is feeding on a star 70 times the mass of our sun bit by bit! as the eaten mass flows towards the black hole, fricton heats it up to temperatures nearly 5000 times the heat of out sun!
                    Yet the black hole is only 15.65 the times our sun and is only big enough just to put a shadow on corsica.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    3. Super Massive Black holes!
                    <br>
                    You see, There are a lot of black holes than grow upto 150 times our sun. Then, We hit a curious gap in the scale. We thought of black holes to be consistently growing, but it seems this process is too slow for these black holes. There is one reason for this big gap.
                    to make Big black holes we need the biggest stars to ever exist. Quasi stars! To get a sense of scale we can compare them to the largest star in the universe, Stephenson 2-18 and the Rho cassiopeaiae. Our sun is like a grain of sand next to them!
                    We're not sure if Quasi stars actually exist. But there is an interesting concept behind them. it is said that the matter in the early universe was so dense that The Quasi stars could grow up to 1000 times our suns mass. The cores of these stars could have actually collasped under the weight of their own star to form black holes 
                    which would constantly feed on the Quasi stars and grow to HUGE sizes! They would be a lot bigger than any modern stellar black hole and several thousands times the size of our sun and wider than the entire earth!
                    <br>
                    Most centres of galaxies have a supermassive black holes in them and they are monstrous! In the milky way we have the black hole Saggitarius A which is 4 million the times our sun! IT just sits there calm and collected and just does it thing.
                    we know this because we can see a number of stars been thrown around by the black hole. despite the Humongus mass of it its diameter is only 17 times the size of our sun. It is smaller than most massive stars but it is millions of times more massive!
                    The black hole is so small it only contains 0.001% of the whole galaxy's mass.
                    <br>
                    Boy you should thank the Saggitarius A black hole as some of the black hole aren't gentle giants. Especially not when their feeding on the clouds of mass in their galaxy.
                    The supermassive black hole in the center of the BL Lacertae galaxy is feeding on so much of its galaxy that it shoots jets of plasma at nearly the spped of light!
                    <br>
                    Now Black holes get so massive star just seem like a joke! The Galaxy Cygnus A has a black hole 2.5 billion times the mass of our sun! and is 14.7 billion kms wide.
                    It eats so much mass that it has shaped its disc like a shape of a magnetic funnel spewing gas out making tremendous Radio lobes towering above the galaxy half a billion light years in diameter.
                    Another super massive black hole sits in the middle of The galaxy Messier 87. It is the first black hole we got a picture of! It is so big it can fit the entire solar system inside it comfortably. Yet there is a scale Even bigger Than this! 
                </p>
                <h1>4. ULTRAMASSIVE BLACK HOLES!</h1>
                <p>
                    Now we reach the biggest object that could possibly Every exist! They have eaten so much that they have grown to tens of billions times the mass of our sun. Their gravity the engine for a quasor and an acretion disc shining brighter than 1000's of galaxies!!
                    <br>
                    The black hole sitting in the center of the Galaxy OJ 287 is 18 billion times the mass of our sun! It is so big it has a supermassive black hole about 40 times the size of the Saggitarius A black hole orbiting around it!
                    This really disobeys imagination! It can fis 3 solar systems side by side inside it!
                    <br>
                    LETS END THIS COMPARISION AND GET TO THE KING OF KINGS..
                    <br>
                    TON 618. the biggest black hole in the universe that is seen consuming galaxies worth of matter and shining with the power of 100 trillion stars! It is visible from 18 billion light years away! It has a monstrous 66 billion times the size of our sun! so massive it would take light itself 1 week to reach the center of this black hole! ABout 11 solar systems can fit side by side in it! It argubly is the biggest black hole in the universe.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> They very well could be bigger black holes than this. But there is one thing we can agree on. Black holes are dangerous and monstrous! They will be here after every thing dies and will still be consuming things for ever and ever and ever..</p>
                <h1> It is not that easy to rank black holes like trading cards! While we know the information of hundreds of millions of stars we only know a few dozen black holes properly! The truth is the physics of black holes is kind of bonkers. So some of these black holes that we talked about </h1>
                <h1>might be way smaller or bigger than we might expect!</h1>
